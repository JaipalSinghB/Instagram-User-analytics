# Instagram-User-analytics
# This project is about to measure the engagement of user with the digital product like Instagram

# Project Description -: This project is about finding the important solutions of
questions which further helps to improve the platform for users and business
perspectives.For example in this project I try to find some useful insights from data for
marketing team for further help in their campaigns from promoting some ads to
find not so active users to engage with platform etc. and also from investors
metrics I tried to find some useful insights.

# Approach -: Initially I tried to understand the data and study it thoroughly to get
the understanding of data by running some basic SQL queries. After I get
comfortable with data, I started to look for answers to questions.
Tech- Stack Used -: I used the My SQL for this project because I am familiar with
the functions and used to of the environment.

# Insights -: From this project I have found several important points for example
I get to know that Sunday and Thursdays are the days when most users get
registered and it is n opportunity for marketing people to run ads to get maximum
impact and reach to users and make it more profitable.
Also get to know that how many accounts are there which are fake accounts and
how the platform if crowded by these bot accounts.

# Results -: This project is my first on SQL which helped me to sharpen my basic  SQL skills
and gave me confidence to further improve and learn more advance topics.
